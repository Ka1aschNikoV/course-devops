Containers share processing resources, CPU and RAM, with the host. However, they have their own filesystem, and possibly storage volumes. This allows to separate the host from the container system, allowing to install different dependencies and setting up networking between the containers. This is different from a guest virtual machine, that fully borrows the resources from the host. The container basically has its own operating system with borrowed resources.
